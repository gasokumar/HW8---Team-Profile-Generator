//This file runs the application. Has inquirer prompts, stores data, then calls the template helper code functions to create html. Then writes to the index file.

//Import fs and inquirer prompts
const fs = require("fs");
const inquirer = require("inquirer");

//Write inquirer prompts

//Store data in an array and use functions that take in that data to create the cards/html.

//Will probably need promises for inquire prompts, then use that data to write to the file.
